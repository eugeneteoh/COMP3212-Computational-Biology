<h2>Week 1</h2>

<h3>Short Videos</h3>

<p>Here are three short videos to give you more understanding of biology</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URUJD5NEXC8">Cell
      structure</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gG7uCskUOrA">From DNA
      to Protein</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FzcTgrxMzZk">Inner
      life of cell</a></li>
</ul>


<h3>Exploring Biological Data</h3>

<p>This week we are going to reinforce concepts learnt during lectures
  about the cell structure, and the central dogma of molecular biology
  regarding the process of information flow from DNA to protein.</p> 

<p>Here we introduce concentration measurements of mRNA (taken by
  microarray) and protein (taken by LC-MS) of 500 genes taken at
  different timesteps within the cell
  cycle <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cell_cycle">wikipedia</a>
  within this
  dataset <a href="https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/notes/comp3212/tutorial/Cell-Cycle-Set.xlsx">Cell-Cycle-Set.xlsx</a>,
  alongside some terms that indicate biological process (GOBP),
  molecular function (GOMF) and where they are located in the
  cell/component (GOCC). As computational biologists, we are very
  interested in modelling the concentration of protein in particular, as
  proteins influence the majority of cell behaviour. It is thought that
  the concentration of any particular protein can be reliably inferred
  from it's respective mRNA level, we will be exploring that concept in
  this tutorial.</p>

<p>During these tutorials we highly recommend you use Python as the
  primary programming language, and all of the examples will use Python;
  however you may choose to use MATLAB/Java. </p>

<h3>Tasks:</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Import the cell cycle dataset excel spreadsheet (using
  Pandas). You may need to do some tidying of the data such as dropping
    rows with missing NaN values.</li>
  <li> Perform exploratory analysis of the data, thus:
    <ol>
      <li>Generate a histogram of one of the cell cycle stages of the
      RNA and protein distribution. Do you notice anything interesting
      with regards to the mean/variance of the distribution?</li> 
      <li>Look at the pairwise correlations between each of the
      RNA/protein columns (this can be achieved using the corr()
      function). Does the change in timestep have much effect on the
	relationship(s) between RNA and protein?</li>
      <li>Generate a scatterplot of the RNA versus. protein for each
      cell cycle stage. Fit a linear model to the data, can we infer
      protein concentration from RNA concentration?<l i=""> 
    </l></li></ol>
</li></ol>

<h2>Week 2</h2>

<h3>Short Videos</h3>

One of the major revolutions in science in the last 10-20 years has been
in sequences.  Here are some videos describing the major sequencing technologies.
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK-HlMaitnE">Sanger
      sequencing</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?annotation_id=annotation_228575861&amp;feature=iv&amp;src_vid=womKfikWlxM&amp;v=fCd6B5HRaZ8">Illumina
      sequencing</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3UHw22hBpAk">Nanopore
      Technology</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.genomicsengland.co.uk/the-100000-genomes-project/">The
      100,000 Genomes Project</a></li> 
  <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD2T0ue6rU8&amp;t=880s">This
      is rather longer, but gives a picture of what is happening now in
      the space of sequencing</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Continuing with the cell cycle, let's go into some deeper analysis of
  the functional role of the proteins and see if there are comparisons
  between RNA and protein.</p>

<h3>Tasks</h3>
<ol>
  <li> Find all genes that contain 'cell cycle' in their GOBP term and
    plot them as a scatterplot (with different colour) overlaid across all
    genes for each cell cycle phase. Is there a stronger/weaker
    correlation?
  </li><li>  Repeat task 1 by finding genes that contain 'ribosome' in their
    GOCC term.
  </li><li> Count the number of occurrences of every GOBP term across all
    genes, what are some of the difficulties that arise when using these
    terms? 
  </li><li> Calculate the change in mRNA/protein level across the cell cycle
    by taking the difference at each stage (G1-S, S-G2, G2-G1), and
    standardize the differences by mean-centering and variance
    scaling. Repeat tasks 1 and 2 by plotting the changes in levels with
    GOBP/GOCC labelling. What do we notice about changes in the cell
    cycle? Is there any apparent clustering of GO terms?
</li></ol>

<p>We encourage you to use other terms in GOBP, GOMF or GOCC and try to
  find clustering/correlations by using them.</p>

<p>Here is a jupyter notebook with some
  solutions <a href="https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/notes/comp3212/tutorial/lab1sol.ipynb">jupyter</a> and raw
  python <a href="https://secure.ecs.soton.ac.uk/notes/comp3212/tutorial/solutions.py">python</a></p>
